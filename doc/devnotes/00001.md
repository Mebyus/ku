# Type system

```ku
// Arrays
[4]Foo

// Chunks
[]u32

// Array pointer
[*]u8


```

## Custom types

```ku
// Custom type can be defined by giving a name to any other type.
type Foo => ...

// Here we create a new custom type Bar which is defined as a struct with
// two fields.
type Bar => struct {
    a: str,
    b: uint,
}
```

Methods can only be attached to custom types.

## Tinting

Some types can be statically tinted to another types. Tinting is memory safe operation.
One type can be tinted to another only if they have common memory layout. In other words
type tinting is a bookkeeping operation by compiler for programmer, it does not involve
any runtime penalty.

```ku
type Foo => u32

fun convert(c: []u32) => []Foo {
    ret #tint([]Foo, c);
}

type Bar => struct {
    a: str,
    b: uint,
}

type Other => Bar

fun convert2(bar: *Bar) => *Other {
    bar.a = "hello";
    other := #tint(*Other, bar);
    ret other;
}
```

## Integer coercion

Coercion can be applied to integer types (and their custom derivatives) to change
their size/signedness.

```ku
fun coerce_u64(x: u64) => u32 {
    ret #coerce(u32, x);
}
```
